# Commit Rules Specification

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification combined with Issue Hash Tag for version control management.

## üìã Commit Format Specification

### **Basic Format**
```
<type>[optional scope]: #<issue-number> <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Note:** English is allowed for commit messages (to support development workflow analysis requirements)

### **Examples**
```bash
feat: #26 implement product details page navigation
fix: #26 resolve product list click handler issues
chore: #26 update product-related dependencies
refactor: #26 restructure product components architecture
```

### **Phase-Based Development Format (For Staged Development)**
For projects using staged development process, include Phase information for enhanced Git analysis:

```
<type>: #<issue-number> Phase <X.Y> - <description>
```

**Phase-Based Examples:**
```bash
feat: #31 Phase 1.1 - implement ProductCreateForm independent component
feat: #31 Phase 1.2 - implement ProductEditForm independent component  
feat: #31 Phase 1.3 - implement ProductDraftForm independent component
feat: #31 Phase 2.1 - update router configuration for independent components
fix: #31 Phase 2.2 - complete i18n internationalization fixes
docs: #31 Phase 1.0 - add ProductForm architecture refactor requirements
test: #31 Phase 3.1 - add unit tests for independent form components
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Commit Types

### **Primary Types**
| Type | Description | Usage |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `feat` | New feature | Adding new functionality or features |
| `fix` | Bug fix | Fixing bugs or issues |
| `chore` | Maintenance | Updating dependencies, config files, etc. |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring | Improving code structure without changing functionality |

### **Secondary Types**
| Type | Description | Usage |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `docs` | Documentation | Updating documentation, comments |
| `style` | Code formatting | Code style, whitespace, semicolons, etc. |
| `test` | Testing | Adding or modifying tests |
| `build` | Build system | Changes affecting build system or external dependencies |
| `ci` | CI/CD | Continuous integration configuration files and scripts |
| `perf` | Performance | Performance improvements |
| `revert` | Revert | Reverting previous commits |

## üî¢ Issue Hash Tag Specification

### **Required Issue Number**
- Every commit must be associated with a corresponding Issue
- Format: `#<issue-number>`
- Position: Between type and description

### **Issue Number Verification**
When executing commit, if unsure about the current Issue Hash Tag:
1. **Check current branch name** - Usually contains issue number
2. **Review GitHub Issues** - Confirm the issue being worked on
3. **Ask project manager** - Verify correct issue number with user

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Never guess or randomly fill in Issue numbers**

## üìù Description Writing Guidelines

### **Description Principles**
- Use imperative mood (e.g., add, fix, update)
- Start with lowercase
- No period at the end
- Concise and clear description of changes
- **English writing is allowed** (to support development workflow analysis requirements)
- **Include Phase information** for staged development projects to enable rapid Git analysis

### **Good Description Examples**

**Standard Format:**
```bash
feat: #26 add product details page with image gallery
fix: #26 resolve navigation issue from product list
chore: #26 update typescript dependencies to latest version
refactor: #26 extract product card component for reusability
```

**Phase-Based Format (For Staged Development):**
```bash
feat: #31 Phase 2.1 - update router configuration for independent components
fix: #31 Phase 2.2 - complete i18n internationalization fixes
docs: #31 Phase 1.0 - add ProductForm architecture refactor requirements
test: #31 Phase 3.1 - add comprehensive form validation tests
```

### **Descriptions to Avoid**
```bash
# ‚ùå Too brief
feat: #26 update

# ‚ùå Unclear description
fix: #26 fix some bugs

# ‚ùå Using past tense
feat: #26 added product details

# ‚ùå Capitalize first letter
feat: #26 Add product details page
```

## üîÑ Scope Usage Guidelines

### **Common Scopes**
- `auth` - Authentication related
- `api` - API related
- `ui` - User interface
- `deps` - Dependencies
- `config` - Configuration files
- `test` - Testing related

### **Scope Examples**
```bash
feat(ui): #26 implement responsive product details layout
fix(api): #26 handle product fetch error scenarios
chore(deps): #26 upgrade react router to v6.8
refactor(auth): #26 simplify user permission checks
```

## üéØ Commit Decision Self-Check
**Triggered by CLAUDE.md Master Protocol**

### **Commit Context Analysis** (20 seconds)
- [ ] **Issue Identification**: What issue number applies? [Verify from branch/context]
- [ ] **Change Classification**: What type of change is this? [feat/fix/chore/refactor/docs/test]
- [ ] **Scope Assessment**: Does this need a scope? [Component/domain affected]
- [ ] **Phase Identification**: Is this staged development? [Include Phase X.Y if applicable]

### **Commit Standards Validation** (30 seconds)
- [ ] **Format Compliance**: Does format follow specification? [type: #issue Phase X.Y - description]
- [ ] **Description Quality**: Is description imperative, clear, and accurate? [Review guidelines]
- [ ] **Issue Verification**: Is issue number confirmed correct? [Check branch/ask user if unsure]
- [ ] **Phase Mapping**: Does Phase number match current development stage? [Cross-reference with docs]

### **Pre-commit Quality Gate** (20 seconds)
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Have I run required checks? [lint/test/build]
- [ ] **Completeness**: Are all related changes included in this commit? [Logical grouping]
- [ ] **Documentation Impact**: Does this change require doc updates? [Identify files to update]
- [ ] **Future Analysis**: Will this commit be easily identifiable in git history? [Search-friendly]

**Return to CLAUDE.md with: Commit Message, Quality Confirmation, Documentation Updates Needed**

## üö¶ Execution Process

### **Pre-commit Checklist**
- [ ] Confirm Issue Hash Tag is correct
- [ ] Select appropriate commit type
- [ ] Write clear description
- [ ] Code passes lint checks
- [ ] Related tests pass

### **Handling Unknown Issue Numbers**
1. Check current working branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. Review recent commit history: `git log --oneline -5`
3. Check GitHub Issues page
4. **Ask user**: "Please confirm the Issue Hash Tag number for current work"

### **Commit Example Process**
```bash
# 1. Check current status
git status

# 2. Stage changes
git add .

# 3. Execute commit (confirm issue number)
git commit -m "feat: #26 implement product details page navigation"

# 4. Push to remote (if needed)
git push origin feature-branch
```

## üîç Phase-Based Commit Search

### **Rapid Git Analysis Commands**
For projects using staged development, use these commands for efficient commit analysis:

```bash
# Search all Phase commits in current branch
git log dev..HEAD --grep="Phase [0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+" --reverse --format="%h %s"

# Search specific issue Phase commits  
git log dev..HEAD --grep="#31 Phase" --reverse --format="%h %s"

# Search specific phase number
git log dev..HEAD --grep="Phase 2\." --reverse --format="%h %s"

# Search by commit type and phase
git log dev..HEAD --grep="feat.*Phase" --reverse --format="%h %s"
git log dev..HEAD --grep="fix.*Phase" --reverse --format="%h %s"
```

### **Benefits for Development Process**
- **Rapid Context Understanding** - Instantly identify completed phases
- **Efficient Branch Analysis** - Skip irrelevant commits, focus on development stages
- **Phase-to-Commit Mapping** - Clear correspondence between project phases and git history
- **Documentation Sync** - Easy verification of progress against actual commits
